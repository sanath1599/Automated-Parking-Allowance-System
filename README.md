# Automatic-Parking-Allowance-System
In this project, Digital Image Processing-based prototype is developed. Actions such as Image Acquisition, enhancement that is pre-processing, Segmentation of the license plate and then application of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is applied to store the number on text form. The plate number is displayed as text on the terminal using the principal of OCR with help of pytesseract. OpenCV 3.0.0 is used to apply image processing in Python 2.7
